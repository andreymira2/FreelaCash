Analyze the app from a logic and data-flow perspective.

Task:
Perform a deep analysis of how financial logic is currently handled across the app
(expenses, projects, payments, recurring items, projections).

I believe the logic is fragmented across multiple functions and components.
My goal is to evolve the app into a more cohesive system with a central financial brain.

What I want to achieve:
- A unified mental model for how money flows through the app
- A single source of truth for:
  • past data (history)
  • present state (current month / open obligations)
  • future projections (recurring expenses, retainers, expected income)
- Consistent rules for how expenses, projects and projections interact

You are allowed to:
- Question current logic decisions
- Identify duplicated or conflicting calculations
- Propose a central “financial engine” or core logic layer
- Suggest refactors that consolidate logic into a single system

What to analyze:
1) How expenses, projects, payments and recurring items are currently calculated
2) Where logic is duplicated or disconnected
3) How time (months, recurrence, projections) is handled
4) How totals, balances and forecasts are derived
5) Where edge cases may break consistency

What to propose:
- A conceptual model for a unified financial brain
- Clear responsibilities for this central logic
- How UI layers should consume this logic (read-only vs actions)
- How past, present and future data should be reconciled
- How this can scale as more rules are added

Constraints:
- No backend
- No cloud
- No AI features
- Use existing data where possible
- This can be a structural refactor, but must be realistic

Output:
- A clear diagnosis of current logical fragmentation
- A proposed unified architecture (conceptual, not just code)
- Suggested next steps to evolve the app toward this model
- Optional: examples of how one feature (e.g. expenses or projections) would benefit

This is a research and design task.
Depth is more important than speed.
